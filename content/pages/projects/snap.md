The Game
--------

![A screenshot of the game Snap!](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/snap)

_Snap!_ is a game that focuses on word association, and aims to be a useful tool for brainstorming.

The premise is simple. Everybody participates on his or her computer. The leader enters a word, and everyone else enters topics related to that word. Whenever you get the same word as somebody else, you get a point.

_Snap!_ is a quick game with three aims:

*   Energize participants and activate people's brainpower
*   Create a sense of shared identity among participants of the same sector
*   Learn from participants about what concepts they associate with the topic

For the rules of _Snap!_ on paper, please see the [lecture notes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-slides-and-readings#Snap) introducing the game.
