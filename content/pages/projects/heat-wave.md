The Game
--------

When disasters strike, Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers are often among the first to provide relief to the victims. But in most cases, acting before a disaster to mitigate its effects can save more lives. For heat waves, linking early warning with early action involves taking precautions like having older citizens drink more water.

_Heat Wave_, the game, provides the player with a scenario that mimics a heat wave forecast, and pairs it with actions your character can take to mitigate its effects.

— Miriam Proznitz, Team _Heat Wave_
