Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _CMS.611J Creating Video Games_ as it was taught by Philip Tan, Sara Verrilli, Richard Eberhardt, and Andrew Haydn Grant in Fall 2014.

In this course, students learned creative design and production methods while working together in small teams to design, develop, and thoroughly test their own original digital games. Design iteration across all aspects of video game development was stressed. Students were required to support and challenge their game design decisions with focus testing and data analysis.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Learn how to work in a team to solve a creative problem
*   Implement productive project management strategies
*   Apply the iterative process to all aspects of video game development, including game design, audio design, visual aesthetics, fiction writing, programming, and project management)
*   Engage in playtesing and data analysis
*   Gain exposure to professionals in the industry
*   Gain experience working with a client

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Students interested in designing games for entertainment often go on to take _CMS.617 Advanced Game Studio_ and [_CMS.610 Media Industries and Systems_](./resolveuid/d166d7968b0da0a07fc066905bc32723). Students interested in designing games for education usually take [_CMS.615 Games for Change_](/courses/cms-615-games-for-social-change-fall-2013/) and [_CMS.590J Computer Games and Simulations for Investigation and Education_](/courses/11-127j-computer-games-and-simulations-for-education-and-exploration-spring-2015/). Some students develop an academic interest in games, and for them, courses like [_CMS.300 Introduction to Videogame Studies_](/courses/cms-300-introduction-to-videogame-studies-fall-2011/) and _CMS.616J Games and Culture_ provide a good foundation for their work.

    ### Lecture/Lab
    
    This course was taught in a room with tiered fixed furniture, A/V equipment, and board space. The instructors would have preferred to teach the course in a flat classroom (not tiered) equipped with moveable tables and chairs.

Assessment
----------

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 25% Preparedness for class, which included overall participation in individual and group exercises in class and in group focus testing, as well as participation in the Game Engine Tutorial Assignment (PDF)
- 15% Team project 1
- 15% Team project 2
- 15% Team project 3
- 30% Team project 4


### Project Grade Breakdown
_Note:_ Students shared 80% of their grades on individual projects with their team members.
- 20% Game functionality. Teams were required to meet specific project constraints as well as standards of playability, code stability and adequate user feedback.
- 20% Adherence to and rigorous use of iterative design process, including responsiveness to tester and instructor feedback.
- 20% Teamwork and project management, including the thoughtful and consistent use of project management methods and tools.
- 20% Individually written postmortem, assessed on the basis of clarity and depth of writing.
- 20% Group postmortem presentation, assessed on the basis of clarity and depth of presentation.
### Instructor Insights on Assessment
This course focused on teaching students effective processes and procedures for working as a team on a complex, multi-functional project. While it was important for them to deliver projects successfully, we were more interested in helping students learn how to practice and improve their project management and group teamwork skills. Their project grades depended heavily on the methods, tools, and processes they used to develop their games, as well as the justification and explanation of the choices they made in organizing their teams and projects. We used multiple methods to capture this information, including presentations, written reports, design diaries, project management documentation, and mandatory in-class playtesting sessions.

Student Information
-------------------

![CMS-611_stat-students.png](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/cms-611_stat-students)

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

### Breakdown by Major

*   Mostly [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) undergraduate students and [Comparative Media Studies/Writing](http://cmsw.mit.edu/) undergraduate students.
*   Typically, undergraduates from fields such as biology, mathematics, mechanical engineering, physics and oceanography also enroll.

### Typical Student Background

During the Fall 2014 offering of the course, women constituted 1/4 of the class.

Students brought very different tastes and experiences to the class based on having played games throughout their lives, but students did not have to be “gamers” to enroll or excel in the course.

### _Ideal Class Size_

The ideal class size is 30-35 students per section. This size allows students have the opportunity to work on multiple teams with different students on each, as well as to form teams for the final project that are big enough to fail. We purposefully set teams up for the final project to have communication issues (having 7-8 students on a single team) because part of their challenge is to use the tools and methods we provide to overcome the challenge. A class size of about 35 students is still small enough, however, to allow instructors to get to know students well. This is important because it helps instructors assess and intervene when teams are having motivational or interpersonal issues.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

Met 2 times per week for 3 hours per session; 27 sessions total; mandatory attendance.

Use of class time varied widely as students moved through different stages of each project. Main activities, with approximate average time spent, included:

*   [Lectures]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-videos) (1-2 hours/week)
*   Discussion (1 hour/week)
*   Workshop (1 hour/week)
*   Playtesting (variable)
*   Presentations (variable)

Out of Class
------------

Students completed most of their game project development outside of class, working collaboratively to meet regular deadlines.
